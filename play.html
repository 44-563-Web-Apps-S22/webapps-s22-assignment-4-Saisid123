            ARI. Good day to you, brother.<br>

CHRY. And to you also, brother.<br>

ARI. Do you know what brings me here?<br>

CHRY. No, I do not; but I am ready to hear it, if it pleases you to
tell me.<br>

ARI. You have known Clitandre for some time now?<br>

CHRY. Certainly; and he often comes to our house.<br>

ARI. And what do you think of him?
