        <p>
            ARI. Good day to you, brother.<br>

CHRY. And to you also, brother.<br>

ARI. Do you know what brings me here?<br>

CHRY. No, I do not; but I am ready to hear it, if it pleases you to
tell me.<br>

ARI. You have known Clitandre for some time now?<br>

CHRY. Certainly; and he often comes to our house.<br>

ARI. And what do you think of him?<br>

CHRY. I think him to be a man of honour, wit, courage, and
uprightness, and I know very few people who have more merit.<br>

ARI. A certain wish of his has brought me here; and I am glad to see
the esteem you have for him.<br>

CHRY. I became acquainted with his late father when I was in Rome.<br>

ARI. Ah!<br>

CHRY. He was a perfect gentleman.<br>

ARI. So it is said.<br>

CHRY. We were only about twenty-eight years of age, and, upon my word,
we were, both of us, very gay young fellows.
